            "Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s course.",
            "Its body can survive dynamite blasts without a single scratch, but it hates rain and humidity.",
            "Once a year, this Pok\u00e9mon molts, and its shed shell returns to the soil. This process creates enriched soil, so farmers collect the shells.",
            "When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss.",
            "It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.",
            "Once it sheds its skin, its body turns tender and whitish. Its hide hardens when it\u2019s exposed to air.",
            "It sheds its hide once a year. Its boulder-like body is so tough, even dynamite can\u2019t harm it.",
            "It tumbles down mountains, leaving grooves from peak to base. Stay clear of these grooves.",
            "The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then crumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across fields to promote crop growth."

            "It fires rocks charged with electricity. Even if the rock isn\u2019t fired that accurately, just grazing an opponent will cause numbness and fainting.",
            "Because it can\u2019t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it\u2019s been known to seize nearby Geodude and fire them from its back.",
            "It\u2019s grumpy and stubborn. If you upset it, it discharges electricity from the surface of its body and growls with a voice like thunder.",
            "It shoots large rocks that are charged with electricity. Tremendous electric shocks are flung out across the whole area of impact.",
            "It uses magnetism to accelerate and fire off rocks tinged with electricity. Even if it doesn\u2019t score a direct hit, the jolt of electricity will do the job."
