            "The light of the moon changed Eevee\u2019s genetic structure. It lurks in the darkness, waiting for prey.",
            "It is most active in the wee hours of the night, when moonlight bathes the land. Its large eyes can pierce the darkness and perceive prey with absolute clarity.",
            "When exposed to the moon\u2019s aura, the rings on its body glow faintly and it gains a mysterious power.",
            "When darkness falls, the rings on the body begin to glow, striking fear in the hearts of anyone nearby."
